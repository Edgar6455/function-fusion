# Function Package

This python project provides a framework for defining and manipulating mathematical functions, including polynomials,
trigonometric functions, and composite functions. It supports function application, arithmetic operations on functions,
and differentiation.


## Statement of Objectives

1) Implement mathematical functions using classes:
- Polynomial
- Sine
- Cosine
2) Implement operations involving pairs of functions:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Composition
3) Ensure each function supports the following functionalities:
- Substituting a number into the function
- Calculating its derivative


## Usage

You can find usage examples in file `example_usage.py`.


## Testing

To ensure the functionality of the function_package, **unittest** is used for automated testing. 
The `tests` directory contains a comprehensive suite of tests that cover all necessary functionality, 
ensuring detailed validation of the package.

### Running tests:

A bash script named `setup_and_test.sh` is available in the `scripts` directory. Running this script will add 
function_package to the **PYTHONPATH** and execute the tests.
